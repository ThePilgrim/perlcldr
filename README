Locale-CLDR

Please note that this code requires Perl 5.10.1 and above in the main. There are some parts that require
Perl 5.18 and if you are using Unicode in Perl you really should be using Perl 5.18 or later

The general overview of the project is to convert the XML of the CLDR into a large number of small Perl
modules that can be loaded from the main Local::CLDR when needed to do what ever localisation is required.

Note that the API is not yet fixed. I'll try and keep things that have tests stable but any thing else 
is at your own risk.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

Locale Data

This package comes with the Locale data for en_US, other locale data can be found in the Locale::CLDR::Locales::*
distributions

Building from github

The data is built with the mkcldr.pl script which I use to download the
latest CLDR data file and process the data. This can be found on github at
https://github.com/ThePilgrim/perlcldr either clone or get hold of the zip
file and extract it to a new directory on your system.

The mkcldr.pl script is in the Locale-CLDR directory. Run the script with the
optional -v (verbose) flag and come back in 40 minuites or so and you will have 
a Distributions directory with each of the language cpan distributions in it.

In the lib directory you will also find a Bundle directory that bundles the 
data into regions

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
