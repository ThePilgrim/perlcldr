Locale-CLDR

This code requires Perl 5.10 or above. There are some features that require Perl 5.18 or above.

The general overview of the project is to convert the XML of the CLDR into a large number of small Perl
modules that can be loaded from the main Local::CLDR when needed to do what ever localisation is required.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

The installation comes with the mkcldr.pl script which I use to download the
latest CLDR data file and process the data.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
